Our aim is to add to the research that currently exists on creating more sustainable models of food (intake and transportation). Right now what makes more sense is to have larger crops and make them travel, but we have to make changes to the economic system to make these decisions more feasible. What we are doing is adding more useful information for this.
We have to make people see this feasible, or see how to make it feasible, in order to make it happen, once the policies change. 
Policies that encourage local production or technologies that makes it happen ()


- Sometimes crops are closer to the next county. What to do there?
- We are not accounting for imports from other countries, specially Canada and Mexico would be important to keep into account.
- We are not talking about what happens, we are talking about potential case scenarios.
- A second phase for this would be to see where there could actually be crops, given certain land use, weather and climate scenarios.
